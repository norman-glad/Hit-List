A minimalist, drag-and-drop task manager with zero backend. Your data lives in the URL.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot or GIF here -->
<!-- ![HitLIST Screenshot](./docs/screenshot.png) -->

## How It Works

No backend, no database, no accounts. HitLIST encodes your entire workspace — lists, positions, theme — into the URL itself.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Browser URL"] -->|"Page load<br/>readUrlParams()"| B["⚛️ React State<br/><code>lists, operatorName, powerColor</code>"]
    B -->|"User edits<br/>(add item, drag, rename)"| C["🔄 useUrlSync<br/>buildUrl()"]
    C -->|"history.replaceState()"| A
```

Every change you make instantly updates the URL. Reload the page — everything is exactly where you left it.

## Save & Share with Bookmarks

The URL **is** your save file. That means:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant You
    participant Browser
    participant URL

    You->>Browser: Set up your workspace
    Browser->>URL: State auto-encodes to URL
    Note over You,URL: ── Save ──
    You->>Browser: Press Cmd+D / Ctrl+D
    Browser->>URL: Bookmark saves full URL
    Note over You,URL: ── Restore (any time) ──
    You->>Browser: Open bookmark
    URL->>Browser: Full state decoded from URL
    Browser->>You: Workspace exactly as you left it
    Note over You,URL: ── Share ──
    You->>Browser: Click "Copy URL"
    Browser->>You: Clipboard has shareable link
    You->>URL: Send link to anyone
    URL->>Browser: They see your exact workspace
```
